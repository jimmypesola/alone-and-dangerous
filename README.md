# Alone And Dangerous

An adventure game in Zelda style for the Commodore 64.

## Prerequisites for compilation and execution

- You will need ACME assembler. The compilation script needs to have acme.exe in your PATH environment variable.
   ACME assembler can be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/acme-crossass/).

- Python version 2.7.x (or Perl 5.18 and higher) is required for compressing the game map data. python.exe needs to be in your PATH environment variable.

- Exomizer v3 is required for compressing the game code + graphics. exomizer.exe needs to be in your PATH environment variable.

- The Vice C64 emulator is required recommended for both building the d64 disk image and running the game. For automatic startup x64.exe needs to be set in your PATH environment variable, as well as c1541.exe.

## Optional tools

- Sprite data was created using SpritePad 2.0 beta, screen graphics were made with CharPad.
   Both tools can be found [here](http://www.subchristsoftware.com/). 

- Goattracker 2.73 was used to compose the music and create the sound effects.
